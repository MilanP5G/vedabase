# Vedabase

Welcome to Vedabase! This gem allows you to see some of the most popular books from His Divine Grace AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Śrīla Prabhupāda - a spiritual teacher who spread the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement across the world.
You can choose a book that you would like to know more about and have a chance to read the introduction of your chosen book.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'vedabase'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install vedabase

## Usage

Once you run the program, you have a choice of three books that you can read into.
To start reading the introduction to a book, you can type in the number of that specific book.
Once you have read the introduction of your chosen book, you have an option to return to the main menu by typing 'menu' in the terminal or leaving the program by typing 'exit'.
If you have chosen 'menu', then you can again choose a book that you would like to read into by inputting it's respective number or leave by typing in 'exit'.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
